# Tic-Tac-Toe
Implementation of Tic Tac Toe game in Java.

This is an AI intelligence game, where computer has given intelligence in how to make a opitmal move.

For choosing the optimal or best move for computer, I use Minimax Algorithm. 
When both the computer and player plays strategically, every time the game will be tie. Or if the player doesn't play efficiently, maximum time computer will win the game.
